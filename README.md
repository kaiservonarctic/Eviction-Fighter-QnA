The Eviction Fighter is intended to help tenants and attorneys who serve them fight unlawful evictions. 
The Fighter helps users drill down on and understand the legal issues facing them. 

An eventual goal is to add document automation. At this time the focus is solely on the question and answer process to provide legal information relevant to a user's situation.

This tool is not to be used as legal advice. It is best thought of as an interactive alternative to legal FAQs. Always consult an attorney if seeking legal advice.
